## About me

> "Helping create high-value solutions in complex environments."

and

> "It's all about getting stuff done."

are my motto.

In various roles including: developer, Scrum Master, Product Owner, project manager, sub-project manager, architect, troubleshooter, I have more than 25 years of project experience.

My focus is on the development of backend software and matching CLI and TUI tools, often functional web interfaces without bells and whistles, because I can't do those.

I am a follower of the keep it simple, stupid (KISS) principle and so I develop my software and tools.

__Due to health problems I have to step back a bit but I am always available for short term projects or as ask me anything partner.__

In parallel I would like to give young developers some tips and recommendations with the publication of my [fieldnotes](https://github.com/vbd/Fieldnotes) so that they don't make the same mistakes I did.

__Developers are much more than just code monkeys!__ Greetings to a former project partner who called me and other project participants like that. I hadn't known the expression before. May you, too, occasionally experience enlightenment.
